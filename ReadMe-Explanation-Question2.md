Regarding question 2:
I wasnt sure if you wanted the solution to be in the format of the appropriate sql tabs (which I wrote with MySQL Workbench),
or a python program which connects to a database in mysql and does the operations on the database within the program.
So I made both ways.

The directory contains the sql tabs (each for: creating the tables, inserting the data, and the query)
the .py file is a python program which connects to the database
